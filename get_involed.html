                <p>Lime Kiln Point State Park, also known as “Whale Watch Park” for its abundance of cetaceans, is world renowned as one of the best places to watch whales and other wildlife. The park spans 36 acres of diverse terrain, with forested highlands, rocky shoreline, and expansive beaches. The park also has an iconic lighthouse constructed in 1919 that still helps ships navigate through the Haro Strait. In addition to seeing orca and minke whales, visitors can also catch a glimpse of seals and sea lions, porpoises, bald eagles and other sea birds, and otters.</p>

                <p>Thirty-five years ago, Mount Saint Helens was the fifth-tallest peak in Washington State, but a catastrophic eruption forever changed its landscape and its inhabitants. The Washington State Department of Game estimates that almost 7,000 large animals died in the eruption and ensuing lahars. More than three decades later, the nutrient-rich volcanic soil has borne lush plant life and seen a return of many native animal species. The Mount Saint Helens Wildlife Area, which includes 3,940 acres, provides opportunities to view ungulates, including deer and elk; cougars; coyotes; amphibians, including Pacific tree frogs and western toads; reptiles, including northern alligator lizards and northwestern garter snakes; waterfowl; birds of prey; and songbirds.</p>

                <p>Crowned by the expansive Deception Pass Bridge, Deception Pass State Park encompasses more than 4,100 acres and includes 77,000 feet of saltwater shoreline. Deception Pass Bridge, which actually includes two bridges that span Deception Pass to the south and Canoe Pass to the north, connects Whidbey Island to the Fidalgo Islands. The bridge, which was completed in 1935, provides unsurpassed water, landscape, and wildlife views. Beyond its span, the varied topography of the park also provides viewing opportunities, including seabirds such as cormorants; bald eagles; seals; whales; and porpoises.</p>

                <p>Mount Rainier’s Paradise, which earned its name from an early visitor’s proclamation, “Oh, what a paradise!”, is a haven for plant and animal life alike. Located 19 miles east of Mount Rainier’s Nisqually entrance, Paradise is at an elevation of 5,400 feet. According to the National Park Service, it’s the “snowiest place on Earth where snowfall is measured regularly,” but during temperate weather, it’s also one of the best places to view wildlife. Approximately 126 species of birds, including the Spotted Owl, Little Willow Flycatcher, and Harlequin Duck; 54 species of mammals, including the red fox, black bear, and hoary marmot; and 17 species of amphibians and reptiles live at Mount Rainier National Park.</p>
