        <h1>Where To View Wildlife in Washington State</h1>
        <p>Washington is a biodiverse state with nine distinct eco-regions and thousands of wildlife species, including
            20,000
            invertebrates, 470 freshwater and marine fishes, 341 birds, 140 mammals, 25 amphibians, and 21 reptiles.
            Most of the
            ecosystem types in the American west occur within Washington, including freshwater, marine, grassland,
            shrubland,
            and forest ecosytems. Within this rich diversity of terrain you can find wolves and whales, bats and birds,
            grizzlies and gophers, cougars and caribou and more. The stateâ€™s vast and varied terrain provides an
            abundance of
            wildlife viewing opportunities, as well. From Mount Saint Helens to Mount Rainier and from Lime Kiln Point
            to
            Deception Pass, these are the best places to view wildlife near Seattle.</p>
